 o Moved IPC functions to IPC.pm
 o Moved remaining graph functions to Graph.pm
 o Fixed cobjdump for binary analysis

 o Cross-compile instructions (Joel Soete)
 
Version 0.16
 o Many bug fixes and cleanups related to the HTML rendering
 o Better handling of node attributes for code cleanup
 o Many code cleanups to reduce complexity, overall less code
 o Documentation updates

Version 0.15
 o Show location of a function call (--all-locs) (Mel)
 o Graph top-level functions based on regular expressions (Lehr + Mel)
 o Various web-page related options added (Lehr + Mel)
 
Version 0.14
 o More minor bugs
 o Support to show/ignore functions based on a regular expression (Lehr)
 o Add RPM spec file (Lehr)
 o Format nodes that are not traversed differently (Lehr)

Version 0.13
 o Bugfixes 

Version 0.12
 o Graphs are now internally represented as DAGs, massive speedups
 o graph2vrml removed because it was not going anywhere useful
 o Daemon/Client support added
 o GIF support added for web pages
 o Proper checking for availablity of dot
 o Various optimizations and speedups

Version 0.11
 o cdep and cxref methods merged
 o cdep method is MUCH more accurate and is able to determine files to ignore
 o Output printing module added, only cdep uses it currently

Version 0.10
 o Avoid naming collisions where structure names match functions in cxrefdep
 o Improved name collision resolution
 o ncc support added for new method cncc which supports function pointers

Version 0.9
 o xref support added which understands macros
 o Minor bug fixes and cleanups

Version 0.8
 o Modular data collection so that many collection methods can be easily added
   All collection methods are now perl libraries
 o C++ support added
 o Integrated all scripts together so that there is only two principal scripts
 o objdump support so that project does not depend on patched compiled
 o Patches to gcc updated to gcc-3.0.4
 o Patches added for gcc-2.95.3 and gcc-3.2.3
 o glibc workaround added for new version of glib compiling gcc
 o Automated download, compile and patch scripts added for each compiler version

Version 0.7
 o Reverse Call Graph Support
 o Online man pages and documentation help
 
Version 0.5
 o Fix up case where graphs with similar function names sometimes get
   corrupt. Most time it would work out ok, but other times multiple edges or
   unrelated functions were displayed

 o Enforce that the call graph order matches the order in code perfectly. It
   was a very rare case that a depth first search of the call graph would give
   a misleading view of the code

 o Allow multiple functions to be specified to graph. This is really handy
   when a number of API functions map to a much smaller set and it is desirable
   to display all the API wrappers in one place
 
 o Small documentation fix

Version 0.4

 o The order of functions displayed is now in the same order as the source.
   Traversing the graph in depth-first search will be the same order in the
   code

Version 0.3

o Fixed cdepn.pl to work with 2.5.x kernels
